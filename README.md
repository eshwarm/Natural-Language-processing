Language Model Creation:
	
The bigram_trigram_language_model.py will train probabilistic language models to distinguish between words in differentlanguages like English, latin,french, spanish.
Rather than looking up whole words in a dictionary, it will build models of character sequences so you can make a guess about the language of unseen words. 
You will need to use NLTK and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights corpus.
